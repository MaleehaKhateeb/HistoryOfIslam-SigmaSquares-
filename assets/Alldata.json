        "history" : "Adam (Arabic: آدم, romanized: Ādam) is believed to have been the first human being on Earth and the first prophet (Arabic: نبي, nabī) of Islam.Adam's role as the father of the human race is looked upon by Muslims with reverence. Muslims also refer to his wife, Hawā (Arabic: حواء, Eve), as the {mother of mankind}. Muslims see Adam as the first Muslim, as the Quran states that all the Prophets preached the same faith of Islam (Arabic: إسلام, Submission to God).",
        "point1" : "Adam is the name given in Genesis 1-5 to the first human.Beyond its use as the name of the first man, adam is also used in the Bible as a pronoun, individually as {a human} and in a collective sense as mankind. Genesis 1 tells of God's creation of the world and its creatures, including adam, meaning humankind; in Genesis 2 God forms {Adam}, this time meaning a single male human, out of {the dust of the ground}, places him in the Garden of Eden, and forms a woman, Eve, as his helpmate; in Genesis 3 Adam and Eve eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge and God condemns Adam to labour on the earth for his food and to return to it on his death; Genesis 4 deals with the birth of Adam's sons, and Genesis 5 lists his descendants from Seth to Noah.The Genesis creation myth[d] was adopted by both Christianity and Islam, and the name of Adam accordingly appears in the Christian scriptures and in the Quran. He also features in subsequent folkloric and mystical elaborations in later Judaism, Christianity, and gnosticism.",
        "point2" : "The Quran is the central religious text of Islam, believed by Muslims to be a revelation from God. It is organized in 114 chapters (pl.:  suwar, sing.:  sūrah), which consist of verses (pl.:  āyāt, sing.:  āyah, cons.: āyat). In addition to its religious significance, it is widely regarded as the finest work in Arabic literature, and has significantly influenced the Arabic language.Muslims believe that the Quran was orally revealed by God to the final prophet, Muhammad, through the archangel Gabriel incrementally over a period of some 23 years, beginning in the month of Ramadan,when Muhammad was 40; and concluding in 632, the year of his death.Muslims regard the Quran as Muhammad's most important miracle; a proof of his prophethood;and the culmination of a series of divine messages starting with those revealed to Adam, including the Torah, the Psalms and the Gospel. The word Quran occurs some 70 times in the text itself, and other names and words are also said to refer to the Quran.The Quran is thought by Muslims to be not simply divinely inspired, but the literal word of God.Muhammad did not write it as he did not know how to write. According to tradition, several of Muhammad's companions served as scribes, recording the revelations.Shortly after the prophet's death, the Quran was compiled by the companions, who had written down or memorized parts of it.Caliph Uthman established a standard version, now known as the Uthmanic codex, which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today. There are, however, variant readings, with mostly minor differences in meaning.The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical and apocryphal scriptures. It summarizes some, dwells at length on others and, in some cases, presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events.The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance for mankind. It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events, and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence.Supplementing the Quran with explanations for some cryptic Quranic narratives, and rulings that also provide the basis for Islamic law in most denominations of Islam,are hadiths—oral and written traditions believed to describe words and actions of Muhammad.[v][28] During prayers, the Quran is recited only in Arabic.Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a hafiz. A verse is sometimes recited with a special kind of elocution reserved for this purpose, called tajwid. During the month of Ramadan, Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during tarawih prayers. In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse, Muslims rely on exegesis, or commentary rather than a direct translation of the text.",
        "history1" : "The Quran and Hadith give some account of the creation and fall of Adam. Synthesizing the Quran with Sunni interpretations can produce the following account. God created Adam, according to the Quran, from mud or clay and breathed his spirit (rūḥī) into him. Hadith add that he was named Adam after the clay he was made out of, or the skin (adim) of the earth. Some exegetes report that God sent the Angel of Death to gather dust from the earth. The various skin-colors of people are due to the different colors of soil used in creating Adam. The soil also contributed to the idea that there are good people and bad people and everything in between in the world. A Hadith from Sahih al-Bukhari narrated by Abu Hurairah states that Adam was created 60 cubits tall (about 30 meters), and that people in Paradise will look like Adam.According to the Quran, when God informed the angels that he was going to put a successor on Earth, they questioned why God would set wherein a human who would cause blood shed and damage. God then teaches Adam [the names of all things] and assembles the angels in front of Adam so as to show them that the angels know only [save what Thou Hast taught us] but Adam could tell all names. God commands the angels to prostrate before Adam wherein all amongst them obeyed except for Iblis (Satan), who claimed: 'I am better than him. You created me of fire while him you created of mud.' His disobedience of God's command followed by attributing injustice to God, caused him to fall out of God's favor:'And behold, We said to the angels: 'Bow down to Adam' and they bowed down. Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: He was/became of those who reject faith.Adam and his unnamed wife (tradition identify her with Hawā), in Garden Eden. In Sunni traditions, based on biblical reports (Israiliyyat), it is said that, when Adam was sleeping, God took a rib from him and from it he created Eve. While the creation of Adam and Eve is referred to in the Quran, the exact method of creation is not specified.God tells them that they are free to enjoy of its fruits except not to come near the 'tree of immortality', but the devil (shaiṭān) was able to convince them to taste it: 'He said, 'Your Lord has forbidden this tree to you only to prevent you from becoming angels or immortals.''  Where upon God sends Adam and his wife to earth, there they are condemned to 'live and die', but is willing to forgive them.When Adam was cast out of Garden Eden, Adam turned towards God and begged for forgiveness. Therefore, there isn't a doctrine of Original sin in Islamic theology (Kalām) and Adam's sin is not carried by all of his children. In the Qiṣaṣ al-Anbiyāʾ (Prophetic tales) Adam and Eve were cast down far apart, so that they had to search for each other and eventually met each other at Mount Arafat.Hadith say that once Adam was on earth, God (sometimes Gabriel at service of God) taught him how to plant seeds and bake bread. This was to become the way of all of Adam's children.Adam proceeded to live for about 1000 years, though this has been a topic of debate.Humankind would have learned everything from Adam. He was the first to learn to plant, harvest, and bake as well as the first to be told how to repent and how to properly bury someone.It is also said by some scholars that God also revealed the various food restrictions and the alphabet to Adam. He was made the first prophet and it is said that he was taught 21 scrolls and was able to write them himself.",
        "history2" : "[‘Iṣmah]  Muslim scholars can be divided into two groups regarding Adam's impeccability (‘iṣmah): One argues that Adam only became a prophet after he was cast out of paradise. They adhere to the doctrine that ‘iṣmah only applies to prophets after they were sent to a mission. But since there have been no population to whom Adam could have been send, he could not have been a prophet and therefore ‘iṣmah didn't apply until he left paradise.These arguement is, however, rejected by those who argue that prophethood doesn't start with preaching God's word and thus ‘iṣmah begins before the prophetic mission. According to the second point of view, Adam was predestined by God to eat from the forbidden tree, because God planned to set Adam and his progeny on earth from the beginning and thus installed Adam's fall.: 194  By that Adam wouldn't have truly disobeyed, but acted in accordance with God's will to his best ability. For that reason, many Muslim exegetes do not regard Adam and Eve's expulsion from paradise as punishment for disobedience or a result from abused free will on their part,: 171  but as part of God's wisdom (ḥikma) and plan for humanity to experience the full range of his attributes, his love, forgiveness, and power to his creation.By their former abode in paradise, they can hope for return during their life-time.Some Muslim scholars view Adam as an image for his descandents: Humans sin, become aware of it, repent (Tawba), and find back to God. Adam embodies humanity and his fall shows humans how to act, when they sinned.: 194  Unlike Iblis (Satan), Adam asked for forgivness for his transgression.",
        "history3" : "The story of angels prostrating before Adam gave rise to various debates about whether humans or angels rank higher. Angels bowing down before Adam is mentioned as evidence for human's superiority over the angels. Others hold that the prostration does not imply such a thing, but was merely a command or test for the angels. A position, especially found among Mu'tazilites and some Asharites, holds that angels are superior due to their lack of urges and desires.Maturidism generally does not think any of these creatures is superior to the other, and that angels' and prophets' obedience derive from their virtues and insights to God's action, but not as their original purity.In the Quranic version of Adam's fall, Satan tempted them with the promise to become immortal angels. Al-Qushayri comments on 7:20, that Adam's fall is for being like an angel, while angels' fall is because when they desired to be like human. Adam desired an angelic state of no passion and avoiding the fate of death, while Harut and Marut desired the freedom of choice and to rejoice in extravagance.",
        "history4" : "It is evident from the Quran that Adam was the father of contemporary humanity,: 21  but if were has been sentient life before is debated. According to some views, God created thirty times an Adam every 1000 years. After the downfall of each humanity, God left the world uninhabited for 50.000 years, then 50.000 inhabited, and then a new Adam created.: 195  The majority of scholars, however, rejects this opinion, however, they agree that the jinn and animals have lived on earth before. According to the Majallat Al Azhar, nowhere within Islamic texts it is prescribed how long humans existed and every Muslim is free to think that is right, and that the notion of a young earth derives from biblical reports (Israʼiliyyat)",
        "history5" : "Though it is up for debate, it has been said that Eve went through 120 pregnancies with Adam and each of these consisted of a set of twins: a boy and a girl.In some other traditions, their first child was a girl, born alone, called ʿAnāq. According to several sources, God took all of Adam's progeny from his back while they were still in heaven. He asked each of them 'am I not your lord?' as read in verse 7:172 and they all replied yes.For this reason, it is believed that all humans are born with an innate knowledge of God. The most famous of Adam's children are Cain and Abel. Both the brothers were asked to offer up individual sacrifices to God. God accepted Abel's sacrifice because of Abel's righteousness and Cain, out of jealousy, threw a rock at Abel, leading to the first murder in human history: the murder of Abel by Cain.As Adam grieved his son, he would preach to his other children about God and faith in Him. When Adam's death grew near, he appointed his son Seth as his successor.Islamic scholar Sayyid Mumtaz Ali, while commenting on whether Adam was first or Eve, says that 'the fact that Adam was created first is nothing but childish. To begin with, we are tempted to assert that this is so because it was not acceptable to God that a woman is left without a companion for even a second. Therefore, it is for her sake that he created Adam first. But as a matter of fact, the belief that Adam was created first and then came Eve is part of the Christian and Jewish faith. This is not at all part of the Islamic creed. There is no mention in the Quran about who was created first, Adam or Eve.'",
        "history6" : "The truth pertaining to the origin of all human beings is a matter dear to the hearts of many. People from different walks of life, including various ethnic origins and differing educational backgrounds have attempted explanations, however, no story or explanation can take the place of the truth. In the Qur’an Allah informed us of the truth regarding the origin of the humans, and His Prophet, Muhammad, explained this matter to his companions, who explained it to their followers, who explained it to their followers, and so on, until the truth reached the people today.Allah created all the other kinds of creations before He created the humankind. Allah created the water, the air, the heavens, the earth, the trees, the mountains, the valleys, the animals and even the small insects--before he created man. Allah created all these kinds of creations in six days. Each day was like one thousand (1,000) years. At the last part of the sixth day, after the ^Asr time, Adam was created. It was Jumu^ah--Friday.Adam was not derived from apes or animals similar to apes. The apes existed, as did all the other animal kind, before Adam was created. The truth is: the origin of all the humankind is clay, i.e., soil mixed with water. Allah said in Surat al-Mu’minun, Ayah 12: ولقد خلقنا الانسان من سلالة من طين [Surat al-Mu’minun, Ayah 12] which means: The origin of this clay was the soil of this earth. Allah ordered one of the angels to gather a handful of all the different types of the earth’s soils: the black soil, the white soil, the red soil, and all the colors in between these colors; including the soft soil and the firm soil. This angel took a handful from all these different kinds of soil and brought them to Paradise. This soil was mixed with the water of Paradise and from this mixture, the shape of Adam was formed. This is why you find among the offspring of Adam--which includes all people--the white, the black, the red, the yellow, those who are easy, those who are difficult, and those who are in between.For a period of time this shape remained as clay. Then Allah turned this clay into something dry and hard, like pottery. In Surat al-Hijr, Ayah 26, Allah, tabaraka wa ta^ala, said: ولقد خلقنا الانسان من صلصال من حمإ مسنون [Surat al-Hijr, Ayah 26] which means: Allah created Adam (the human being) from a clay that was poured and then dried taking the shape of Adam.>Before Allah turned this clay to flesh, blood, and bones, and before Allah put Adam’s soul into his body, the devil (Iblis) came and examined this creation. Upon inspection, Iblis found this creation had internal cavities, and thus he knew that this creation would need to take things inside its body. Iblis knew this creation would not have the ability to go for long periods of time doing different matters without being in need of some things, like food, drink, rest, and the like. Iblis knew this creation was not like the angels, because angels do not have internal body cavities and need neither food nor drink nor rest. Allah gave them the strength to perform all what Allah ordered them to perform--without the need for eating, drinking, or resting to do so. The angels can bear things which the humans cannot bear. All this,Iblis knew. So Iblis, who was created from a pure flame of fire (which does not produce any smoke); Iblis, a jinn, and the ancestor of all the jinn, who was a believer at this period of time and living in Paradise with the angels worshipping Allah--talked to that shape of Adam. He said to Adam, 'Allah created you for a matter which I cannot perceive.'After the soul of Adam joined his body, Allah bestowed on Adam the knowledge of the names of everything. Allah gave Adam that knowledge without a teacher, i.e., without Adam having to learn from someone to acquire that knowledge. Then Allah ordered the angels to prostrate to Adam out of respect for this special new creation (not out of worship). Iblis was living with the angels, so he, also, was ordered to prostrate to Adam. The angels prostrated to Adam because all the angels are obedient; they do not disobey Allah. Iblis, however, was arrogant. He objected to Allah. Iblis said, 'I was created from fire, and he was only created from soil, so why should I prostrate to him? I will not.' By his statement Iblis meant that Allah was not just in ordering him to prostrate to Adam. Thus, by objecting to Allah and His order, Iblis blasphemed. This was the first blasphemy Iblis committed.When Adam’s soul joined with his body, he sneezed, then said, ‘al-hamdulillah.' Thus, the first words Adam uttered were in praising and thanking Allah. Adam stayed in Paradise for a period of time. During that period Allah created Hawwa’ (Eve), Adam’s wife. She was tall, suitable for the height of Adam who was sixty cubits tall and seven cubits broad. Hawwa’ (Eve) was created from one of Adam’sribs. Ibnu ^Abbas said that Allah created Hawwa’ (Eve) from the shortest rib on Adam’s left side. Adam and Hawwa’ (Eve) lived together in Paradise for a period of time. Allah permitted them to eat from all the fruits of Paradise, except the fruits of one particular tree. Allah enabled them to go from one place to another in the apparent locations of Paradise to eat from the fruits and to benefit from these locations. Adam andHawwa’ (Eve) were not given permission to eat from that tree but Iblis whispered to them to eat from it. Then Hawwa’ (Eve) started encouraging Adam to eat from that tree. Eventually they both ate from it. Doing so was sinful, however it was a small sin and they both quickly repented. What they said is mentioned in Surat al-A^raf, Ayah 23: قالا ربنا ظلمنا أنفسنا وإن لم تغفر لنا وترحمنا لنكونن من الخاسرين  [Surat al-A^raf, Ayah 23] which means: Allah, we did injustice to ourselves. So if You do not forgive us and You do not have mercy on us, we would be losers.> They repented and Allahaccepted their repentance. After this incident, Adam, Hawwa’ (Eve), and Iblis were ordered to leave Paradise. Adam descended from Paradise into India, in a land called Sarandib (Syri Lanka, now-a-days). Hawwa’ (Eve) descended in a location different from Adam. Iblis, descended into an area in present-day Iraq, now a town named al-Ubullah (next to al-Basrah. Later, Adam and Hawwa’ (Eve) were reunited. After Adam descended from Paradise, where he had lived for 130 years, he received the revelation of prophethood from Allah. Adam, the first man, became the first prophet and the first Messenger to whom Allah revealed. Prophet Adam and his wife had many children. Hawwa’ (Eve) gave birth to forty sets of twins. Each womb held a son and a daughter. Their children married and had children, who married and had children, and so on until the humans were spread in the different areas. Adam is the ancestor of all the human beings--without any exception. The lineage of all humans goes back toAdam and Hawwa’ (Eve), even Gog and Magog (Ya’juj and Ma’juj). Prophet Adam taught his children and their children about Islam. Adam lived for many years. He didn’t die until he saw 40,000 of his descendents--and all of them were Muslim. Prophet Adam and Hawwa’ (Eve) loved and worshipped Allah. They used to pray, fast, and go to Hajj (pilgrimage).). Prophet Adam taught his offspring about the attributes which befit Allah and the difference between the Creator and the creations. He taught good behavior, truthfulness, trustworthiness, and sincerity. Allah bestowed many knowledges on Prophet Adam. Allah created in Adam the knowledge of the languages--without having to study them. He spoke eloquently and without having to use signs. Allah created in Adam the knowledge of the matters of earning a living--including how to plant wheat, how to make clothes, and how to make money from gold and silver. Allah created in Adam the knowledge of how to make instruments for planting, like the shovel and sickle, and the knowledge of how to plant seeds, vegetables, and fruits as well as how to harvest. Prophet Adam knew how to build and construct homes and houses and he used to make ceilings and doors for them. Prophet Adam was the first to build the Ka^bah. During his time, the Aqsa Mosque was built in Palestine.",
        "history7" : "Beware of those who claim matters contrary to the truth of Islam. Adam was not the first creation, and all human beings originate from him. Moreover, ProphetMuhammad descended from Prophet Adam. Prophet Muhammad was not the first creation, as some people claim. Also, beware of those who claim the first creation is the light of our Prophet. This is also invalid. There is no sahih hadith from the Prophet claiming such. There is, however, a fabricated hadith that the Prophet addressed Jabir by saying: 'The first creation is the light of your Prophet, O Jabir.' The hafidh, Ahmad al-Ghumariyy, mentioned this hadith was fabricated in his book entitled, Al-Mughir ^Ala-l-Jami^ is-Saghir and the hafidh, as-Suyutiyy, said this hadith is not confirmed. He mentioned it in two (2) of his books: Al-Fatawa and The Explanation of at-Tirmidhiyy. What was confirmed from the Prophet was that the first creation was the original water, which exists now underneath the ^Arsh. Beware of theories which say human beings descended from apes or that Adam was a primitive caveman. Adam was the first man and the first human to receive the Revelation of prophethood. He was the first messenger of Allah and he is the ancestor of every member of the humankind. He taught the first people how to live and how to worship Allah correctly. He was an honored and blessed creation of Allah. He was created from soil. In Surat al-Hajj Ayah 5, Allah said:  [ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إن كُنتُمْ فى رَيْبٍ مّـِنَ الْبَعْثِ فَإنَّـا خَلَقْنَاكُم مّـِن تُرَابٍ [سورة الحج - آية 5  which means: Adam was created from soil.> That is, should one have difficulty conceptualizing that a person can be resurrected--considering this matter is unlikely, a weak possibility, or one that does not occur--then remember that Allah created Adam from soil. Know that the One Who created Adam from soil has the Power to resurrect you after you turn back into soil. This is the truth about Prophet Adam.",
        "heading1" : "According to a revelation received by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the community, the Adam mentioned in the Quran was born 4,598 years before Muhammad.",
        "heading2" : "Abdullah Ibn Al-Iman Ahmad Ibn Hanbal narrated that Ubai Ibn Kab said: 'When Adam's death was near, he said to his children: '0 my children, indeed, I feel an appetite for the fruits of Paradise.' So they went away searching for what Adam had requested. They met with the angels, who had with them his shroud and what he was to be embalmed with. They said to them: '0 Children of Adam, what are you searching for? What do you want? Where are you going?' They said: 'Our father is sick and has an appetite for the fruits of Paradise.' The angels said to them: 'Go back, for your father is going to meet his end soon.' So they returned (with the angels), and when Eve saw them she recognized them. She tried to hide herself behind Adam. He said to her: 'Leave me alone. I came before you; do not go between me and the angels of my Lord.' So they took his soul, embalmed and wrapped him, dug the grave and laid him in it. They prayed on him and put him in his grave, saying: '0 Children of Adam, this is your tradition at the time of death.'Before his death Adam reassured his children that Allah would not leave man alone on the earth, but would send His prophets to guide them. The prophets would have different names, traits and miracles, but they would be united in one thing: the call to worship Allah alone. This was Adam's bequest to his children. Adam finished speaking and closed his eyes. Then the angels entered his room and surrounded him. When he recognized the Angel of Death among them, his heart smiled peacefully.

        "history8" : "Hadith say that once Adam was on earth, God (sometimes Gabriel at service of God) taught him how to plant seeds and bake bread. This was to become the way of all of Adam's children. Adam proceeded to live for about 1000 years, though this has been a topic of debate.",
        "history9" : "Ibn Kathir: Some claim that Adam is buried on the mountain to which he fell in India. Others say that he is buried in Mount Abu Qubays in Mecca, or that Noah took the bodies of Adam and Eve on the Ark and reburied them in Jerusalem."
