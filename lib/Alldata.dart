        "history" : "Adam (Arabic: آدم, romanized: Ādam) is believed to have been the first human being on Earth and the first prophet (Arabic: نبي, nabī) of Islam.Adam's role as the father of the human race is looked upon by Muslims with reverence. Muslims also refer to his wife, Hawā (Arabic: حواء, Eve), as the {mother of mankind}. Muslims see Adam as the first Muslim, as the Quran states that all the Prophets preached the same faith of Islam (Arabic: إسلام, Submission to God).",

        "point1" : "Adam is the name given in Genesis 1-5 to the first human.Beyond its use as the name of the first man, adam is also used in the Bible as a pronoun, individually as {a human} and in a collective sense as mankind. Genesis 1 tells of God's creation of the world and its creatures, including adam, meaning humankind; in Genesis 2 God forms {Adam}, this time meaning a single male human, out of {the dust of the ground}, places him in the Garden of Eden, and forms a woman, Eve, as his helpmate; in Genesis 3 Adam and Eve eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge and God condemns Adam to labour on the earth for his food and to return to it on his death; Genesis 4 deals with the birth of Adam's sons, and Genesis 5 lists his descendants from Seth to Noah.The Genesis creation myth[d] was adopted by both Christianity and Islam, and the name of Adam accordingly appears in the Christian scriptures and in the Quran. He also features in subsequent folkloric and mystical elaborations in later Judaism, Christianity, and gnosticism.",
        // Quran(Clickable_Word)
        "point2" : "The Quran is the central religious text of Islam, believed by Muslims to be a revelation from God. It is organized in 114 chapters (pl.:  suwar, sing.:  sūrah), which consist of verses (pl.:  āyāt, sing.:  āyah, cons.: āyat). In addition to its religious significance, it is widely regarded as the finest work in Arabic literature, and has significantly influenced the Arabic language.Muslims believe that the Quran was orally revealed by God to the final prophet, Muhammad, through the archangel Gabriel incrementally over a period of some 23 years, beginning in the month of Ramadan,when Muhammad was 40; and concluding in 632, the year of his death.Muslims regard the Quran as Muhammad's most important miracle; a proof of his prophethood;and the culmination of a series of divine messages starting with those revealed to Adam, including the Torah, the Psalms and the Gospel. The word Quran occurs some 70 times in the text itself, and other names and words are also said to refer to the Quran.The Quran is thought by Muslims to be not simply divinely inspired, but the literal word of God.Muhammad did not write it as he did not know how to write. According to tradition, several of Muhammad's companions served as scribes, recording the revelations.Shortly after the prophet's death, the Quran was compiled by the companions, who had written down or memorized parts of it.Caliph Uthman established a standard version, now known as the Uthmanic codex, which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today. There are, however, variant readings, with mostly minor differences in meaning.The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical and apocryphal scriptures. It summarizes some, dwells at length on others and, in some cases, presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events.The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance for mankind. It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events, and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence.Supplementing the Quran with explanations for some cryptic Quranic narratives, and rulings that also provide the basis for Islamic law in most denominations of Islam,are hadiths—oral and written traditions believed to describe words and actions of Muhammad.[v][28] During prayers, the Quran is recited only in Arabic.Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a hafiz. A verse is sometimes recited with a special kind of elocution reserved for this purpose, called tajwid. During the month of Ramadan, Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during tarawih prayers. In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse, Muslims rely on exegesis, or commentary rather than a direct translation of the text.",
        // Quran, hadiths and tales[Topic]
        "history1" : "The Quran and Hadith give some account of the creation and fall of Adam. Synthesizing the Quran with Sunni interpretations can produce the following account. God created Adam, according to the Quran, from mud or clay and breathed his spirit (rūḥī) into him. Hadith add that he was named Adam after the clay he was made out of, or the skin (adim) of the earth. Some exegetes report that God sent the Angel of Death to gather dust from the earth. The various skin-colors of people are due to the different colors of soil used in creating Adam. The soil also contributed to the idea that there are good people and bad people and everything in between in the world. A Hadith from Sahih al-Bukhari narrated by Abu Hurairah states that Adam was created 60 cubits tall (about 30 meters), and that people in Paradise will look like Adam.According to the Quran, when God informed the angels that he was going to put a successor on Earth, they questioned why God would set wherein a human who would cause blood shed and damage. God then teaches Adam [the names of all things] and assembles the angels in front of Adam so as to show them that the angels know only [save what Thou Hast taught us] but Adam could tell all names. God commands the angels to prostrate before Adam wherein all amongst them obeyed except for Iblis (Satan), who claimed: 'I am better than him. You created me of fire while him you created of mud.' His disobedience of God's command followed by attributing injustice to God, caused him to fall out of God's favor:'And behold, We said to the angels: 'Bow down to Adam' and they bowed down. Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: He was/became of those who reject faith.Adam and his unnamed wife (tradition identify her with Hawā), in Garden Eden. In Sunni traditions, based on biblical reports (Israiliyyat), it is said that, when Adam was sleeping, God took a rib from him and from it he created Eve. While the creation of Adam and Eve is referred to in the Quran, the exact method of creation is not specified.God tells them that they are free to enjoy of its fruits except not to come near the 'tree of immortality', but the devil (shaiṭān) was able to convince them to taste it: 'He said, 'Your Lord has forbidden this tree to you only to prevent you from becoming angels or immortals.''  Where upon God sends Adam and his wife to earth, there they are condemned to 'live and die', but is willing to forgive them.When Adam was cast out of Garden Eden, Adam turned towards God and begged for forgiveness. Therefore, there isn't a doctrine of Original sin in Islamic theology (Kalām) and Adam's sin is not carried by all of his children. In the Qiṣaṣ al-Anbiyāʾ (Prophetic tales) Adam and Eve were cast down far apart, so that they had to search for each other and eventually met each other at Mount Arafat.Hadith say that once Adam was on earth, God (sometimes Gabriel at service of God) taught him how to plant seeds and bake bread. This was to become the way of all of Adam's children.Adam proceeded to live for about 1000 years, though this has been a topic of debate.Humankind would have learned everything from Adam. He was the first to learn to plant, harvest, and bake as well as the first to be told how to repent and how to properly bury someone.It is also said by some scholars that God also revealed the various food restrictions and the alphabet to Adam. He was made the first prophet and it is said that he was taught 21 scrolls and was able to write them himself.",
        // Theological significance[Topic]  Iṣmah[subtopic]
        "history2" : "[‘Iṣmah]  Muslim scholars can be divided into two groups regarding Adam's impeccability (‘iṣmah): One argues that Adam only became a prophet after he was cast out of paradise. They adhere to the doctrine that ‘iṣmah only applies to prophets after they were sent to a mission. But since there have been no population to whom Adam could have been send, he could not have been a prophet and therefore ‘iṣmah didn't apply until he left paradise.These arguement is, however, rejected by those who argue that prophethood doesn't start with preaching God's word and thus ‘iṣmah begins before the prophetic mission. According to the second point of view, Adam was predestined by God to eat from the forbidden tree, because God planned to set Adam and his progeny on earth from the beginning and thus installed Adam's fall.: 194  By that Adam wouldn't have truly disobeyed, but acted in accordance with God's will to his best ability. For that reason, many Muslim exegetes do not regard Adam and Eve's expulsion from paradise as punishment for disobedience or a result from abused free will on their part,: 171  but as part of God's wisdom (ḥikma) and plan for humanity to experience the full range of his attributes, his love, forgiveness, and power to his creation.By their former abode in paradise, they can hope for return during their life-time.Some Muslim scholars view Adam as an image for his descandents: Humans sin, become aware of it, repent (Tawba), and find back to God. Adam embodies humanity and his fall shows humans how to act, when they sinned.: 194  Unlike Iblis (Satan), Adam asked for forgivness for his transgression.",
        //Adam and the angels[Topic]
        "history3" : "The story of angels prostrating before Adam gave rise to various debates about whether humans or angels rank higher. Angels bowing down before Adam is mentioned as evidence for human's superiority over the angels. Others hold that the prostration does not imply such a thing, but was merely a command or test for the angels. A position, especially found among Mu'tazilites and some Asharites, holds that angels are superior due to their lack of urges and desires.Maturidism generally does not think any of these creatures is superior to the other, and that angels' and prophets' obedience derive from their virtues and insights to God's action, but not as their original purity.In the Quranic version of Adam's fall, Satan tempted them with the promise to become immortal angels. Al-Qushayri comments on 7:20, that Adam's fall is for being like an angel, while angels' fall is because when they desired to be like human. Adam desired an angelic state of no passion and avoiding the fate of death, while Harut and Marut desired the freedom of choice and to rejoice in extravagance.",

        "history4" : "It is evident from the Quran that Adam was the father of contemporary humanity,: 21  but if were has been sentient life before is debated. According to some views, God created thirty times an Adam every 1000 years. After the downfall of each humanity, God left the world uninhabited for 50.000 years, then 50.000 inhabited, and then a new Adam created.: 195  The majority of scholars, however, rejects this opinion, however, they agree that the jinn and animals have lived on earth before. According to the Majallat Al Azhar, nowhere within Islamic texts it is prescribed how long humans existed and every Muslim is free to think that is right, and that the notion of a young earth derives from biblical reports (Israʼiliyyat)",
        // Genealogy of Adam[Topic]
        "history5" : "Though it is up for debate, it has been said that Eve went through 120 pregnancies with Adam and each of these consisted of a set of twins: a boy and a girl.In some other traditions, their first child was a girl, born alone, called ʿAnāq. According to several sources, God took all of Adam's progeny from his back while they were still in heaven. He asked each of them 'am I not your lord?' as read in verse 7:172 and they all replied yes.For this reason, it is believed that all humans are born with an innate knowledge of God. The most famous of Adam's children are Cain and Abel. Both the brothers were asked to offer up individual sacrifices to God. God accepted Abel's sacrifice because of Abel's righteousness and Cain, out of jealousy, threw a rock at Abel, leading to the first murder in human history: the murder of Abel by Cain.As Adam grieved his son, he would preach to his other children about God and faith in Him. When Adam's death grew near, he appointed his son Seth as his successor.Islamic scholar Sayyid Mumtaz Ali, while commenting on whether Adam was first or Eve, says that 'the fact that Adam was created first is nothing but childish. To begin with, we are tempted to assert that this is so because it was not acceptable to God that a woman is left without a companion for even a second. Therefore, it is for her sake that he created Adam first. But as a matter of fact, the belief that Adam was created first and then came Eve is part of the Christian and Jewish faith. This is not at all part of the Islamic creed. There is no mention in the Quran about who was created first, Adam or Eve.'",
        // prophet who built kabbah[Topic]
        "history6" : "The truth pertaining to the origin of all human beings is a matter dear to the hearts of many. People from different walks of life, including various ethnic origins and differing educational backgrounds have attempted explanations, however, no story or explanation can take the place of the truth. In the Qur’an Allah informed us of the truth regarding the origin of the humans, and His Prophet, Muhammad, explained this matter to his companions, who explained it to their followers, who explained it to their followers, and so on, until the truth reached the people today.Allah created all the other kinds of creations before He created the humankind. Allah created the water, the air, the heavens, the earth, the trees, the mountains, the valleys, the animals and even the small insects--before he created man. Allah created all these kinds of creations in six days. Each day was like one thousand (1,000) years. At the last part of the sixth day, after the ^Asr time, Adam was created. It was Jumu^ah--Friday.Adam was not derived from apes or animals similar to apes. The apes existed, as did all the other animal kind, before Adam was created. The truth is: the origin of all the humankind is clay, i.e., soil mixed with water. Allah said in Surat al-Mu’minun, Ayah 12: ولقد خلقنا الانسان من سلالة من طين [Surat al-Mu’minun, Ayah 12] which means: The origin of this clay was the soil of this earth. Allah ordered one of the angels to gather a handful of all the different types of the earth’s soils: the black soil, the white soil, the red soil, and all the colors in between these colors; including the soft soil and the firm soil. This angel took a handful from all these different kinds of soil and brought them to Paradise. This soil was mixed with the water of Paradise and from this mixture, the shape of Adam was formed. This is why you find among the offspring of Adam--which includes all people--the white, the black, the red, the yellow, those who are easy, those who are difficult, and those who are in between.For a period of time this shape remained as clay. Then Allah turned this clay into something dry and hard, like pottery. In Surat al-Hijr, Ayah 26, Allah, tabaraka wa ta^ala, said: ولقد خلقنا الانسان من صلصال من حمإ مسنون [Surat al-Hijr, Ayah 26] which means: Allah created Adam (the human being) from a clay that was poured and then dried taking the shape of Adam.>Before Allah turned this clay to flesh, blood, and bones, and before Allah put Adam’s soul into his body, the devil (Iblis) came and examined this creation. Upon inspection, Iblis found this creation had internal cavities, and thus he knew that this creation would need to take things inside its body. Iblis knew this creation would not have the ability to go for long periods of time doing different matters without being in need of some things, like food, drink, rest, and the like. Iblis knew this creation was not like the angels, because angels do not have internal body cavities and need neither food nor drink nor rest. Allah gave them the strength to perform all what Allah ordered them to perform--without the need for eating, drinking, or resting to do so. The angels can bear things which the humans cannot bear. All this,Iblis knew. So Iblis, who was created from a pure flame of fire (which does not produce any smoke); Iblis, a jinn, and the ancestor of all the jinn, who was a believer at this period of time and living in Paradise with the angels worshipping Allah--talked to that shape of Adam. He said to Adam, 'Allah created you for a matter which I cannot perceive.'After the soul of Adam joined his body, Allah bestowed on Adam the knowledge of the names of everything. Allah gave Adam that knowledge without a teacher, i.e., without Adam having to learn from someone to acquire that knowledge. Then Allah ordered the angels to prostrate to Adam out of respect for this special new creation (not out of worship). Iblis was living with the angels, so he, also, was ordered to prostrate to Adam. The angels prostrated to Adam because all the angels are obedient; they do not disobey Allah. Iblis, however, was arrogant. He objected to Allah. Iblis said, 'I was created from fire, and he was only created from soil, so why should I prostrate to him? I will not.' By his statement Iblis meant that Allah was not just in ordering him to prostrate to Adam. Thus, by objecting to Allah and His order, Iblis blasphemed. This was the first blasphemy Iblis committed.When Adam’s soul joined with his body, he sneezed, then said, ‘al-hamdulillah.' Thus, the first words Adam uttered were in praising and thanking Allah. Adam stayed in Paradise for a period of time. During that period Allah created Hawwa’ (Eve), Adam’s wife. She was tall, suitable for the height of Adam who was sixty cubits tall and seven cubits broad. Hawwa’ (Eve) was created from one of Adam’sribs. Ibnu ^Abbas said that Allah created Hawwa’ (Eve) from the shortest rib on Adam’s left side. Adam and Hawwa’ (Eve) lived together in Paradise for a period of time. Allah permitted them to eat from all the fruits of Paradise, except the fruits of one particular tree. Allah enabled them to go from one place to another in the apparent locations of Paradise to eat from the fruits and to benefit from these locations. Adam andHawwa’ (Eve) were not given permission to eat from that tree but Iblis whispered to them to eat from it. Then Hawwa’ (Eve) started encouraging Adam to eat from that tree. Eventually they both ate from it. Doing so was sinful, however it was a small sin and they both quickly repented. What they said is mentioned in Surat al-A^raf, Ayah 23: قالا ربنا ظلمنا أنفسنا وإن لم تغفر لنا وترحمنا لنكونن من الخاسرين  [Surat al-A^raf, Ayah 23] which means: Allah, we did injustice to ourselves. So if You do not forgive us and You do not have mercy on us, we would be losers.> They repented and Allahaccepted their repentance. After this incident, Adam, Hawwa’ (Eve), and Iblis were ordered to leave Paradise. Adam descended from Paradise into India, in a land called Sarandib (Syri Lanka, now-a-days). Hawwa’ (Eve) descended in a location different from Adam. Iblis, descended into an area in present-day Iraq, now a town named al-Ubullah (next to al-Basrah. Later, Adam and Hawwa’ (Eve) were reunited. After Adam descended from Paradise, where he had lived for 130 years, he received the revelation of prophethood from Allah. Adam, the first man, became the first prophet and the first Messenger to whom Allah revealed. Prophet Adam and his wife had many children. Hawwa’ (Eve) gave birth to forty sets of twins. Each womb held a son and a daughter. Their children married and had children, who married and had children, and so on until the humans were spread in the different areas. Adam is the ancestor of all the human beings--without any exception. The lineage of all humans goes back toAdam and Hawwa’ (Eve), even Gog and Magog (Ya’juj and Ma’juj). Prophet Adam taught his children and their children about Islam. Adam lived for many years. He didn’t die until he saw 40,000 of his descendents--and all of them were Muslim. Prophet Adam and Hawwa’ (Eve) loved and worshipped Allah. They used to pray, fast, and go to Hajj (pilgrimage).). Prophet Adam taught his offspring about the attributes which befit Allah and the difference between the Creator and the creations. He taught good behavior, truthfulness, trustworthiness, and sincerity. Allah bestowed many knowledges on Prophet Adam. Allah created in Adam the knowledge of the languages--without having to study them. He spoke eloquently and without having to use signs. Allah created in Adam the knowledge of the matters of earning a living--including how to plant wheat, how to make clothes, and how to make money from gold and silver. Allah created in Adam the knowledge of how to make instruments for planting, like the shovel and sickle, and the knowledge of how to plant seeds, vegetables, and fruits as well as how to harvest. Prophet Adam knew how to build and construct homes and houses and he used to make ceilings and doors for them. Prophet Adam was the first to build the Ka^bah. During his time, the Aqsa Mosque was built in Palestine.",
        // Truth about adam[Topic]
        "history7" : "Beware of those who claim matters contrary to the truth of Islam. Adam was not the first creation, and all human beings originate from him. Moreover, ProphetMuhammad descended from Prophet Adam. Prophet Muhammad was not the first creation, as some people claim. Also, beware of those who claim the first creation is the light of our Prophet. This is also invalid. There is no sahih hadith from the Prophet claiming such. There is, however, a fabricated hadith that the Prophet addressed Jabir by saying: 'The first creation is the light of your Prophet, O Jabir.' The hafidh, Ahmad al-Ghumariyy, mentioned this hadith was fabricated in his book entitled, Al-Mughir ^Ala-l-Jami^ is-Saghir and the hafidh, as-Suyutiyy, said this hadith is not confirmed. He mentioned it in two (2) of his books: Al-Fatawa and The Explanation of at-Tirmidhiyy. What was confirmed from the Prophet was that the first creation was the original water, which exists now underneath the ^Arsh. Beware of theories which say human beings descended from apes or that Adam was a primitive caveman. Adam was the first man and the first human to receive the Revelation of prophethood. He was the first messenger of Allah and he is the ancestor of every member of the humankind. He taught the first people how to live and how to worship Allah correctly. He was an honored and blessed creation of Allah. He was created from soil. In Surat al-Hajj Ayah 5, Allah said:  [ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إن كُنتُمْ فى رَيْبٍ مّـِنَ الْبَعْثِ فَإنَّـا خَلَقْنَاكُم مّـِن تُرَابٍ [سورة الحج - آية 5  which means: Adam was created from soil.> That is, should one have difficulty conceptualizing that a person can be resurrected--considering this matter is unlikely, a weak possibility, or one that does not occur--then remember that Allah created Adam from soil. Know that the One Who created Adam from soil has the Power to resurrect you after you turn back into soil. This is the truth about Prophet Adam.",

So they went away searching for what Adam had requested. They met with the angels, who had with them his shroud and what he was to be embalmed with. They said to them: '0 Children of Adam, what are you searching for? What do you want? Where are you going?' They said: 'Our father is sick and has an appetite for the fruits of Paradise.' The angels said to them: 'Go back, for your father is going to meet his end soon.' So they returned (with the angels), and when Eve saw them she recognized them. She tried to hide herself behind Adam. He said to her: 'Leave me alone. I came before you; do not go between me and the angels of my Lord.' So they took his soul, embalmed and wrapped him, dug the grave and laid him in it. They prayed on him and put him in his grave, saying: '0 Children of Adam, this is your tradition at the time of death.'Before his death Adam reassured his children that Allah would not leave man alone on the earth, but would send His prophets to guide them. The prophets would have different names, traits and miracles, but they would be united in one thing: the call to worship Allah alone. This was Adam's bequest to his children. Adam finished speaking and closed his eyes. Then the angels entered his room and surrounded him. When he recognized the Angel of Death among them, his heart smiled peacefully.

He is the second prophet mentioned in the Quran. Islamic tradition has unanimously identified Idris with the biblical Enoch, although many Muslim scholars of the classical and medieval periods also held that Idris and Hermes Trismegistus were the same person. He is described in the Quran as trustworthy and patient and the Quran also says that he was exalted to a high station. Because of this and other parallels, traditionally Idris has been identified with the biblical Enoch, and Islamic tradition usually places Idris in the early Generations of Adam, and considers him one of the oldest prophets mentioned in the Quran, placing him between Adam and Noah.[11] Idris' unique status inspired many future traditions and stories surrounding him in Islamic folklore. According to hadith, narrated by Malik ibn Anas and found in Sahih Muslim, it is said that on Muhammad's Night Journey, he encountered Idris in the fourth heaven. The traditions that have developed around the figure of Idris have given him the scope of a prophet as well as a philosopher and mystic,[14] and many later Muslim mystics, or Sufis, including Ruzbihan Baqli and Ibn Arabi, also mentioned having encountered Idris in their spiritual visions.",

      "history1" : "The name Idris (إدريس) has been described as perhaps having the origin of meaning interpreter. Traditionally, Islam holds the prophet as having functioned an interpretive and mystical role and therefore this meaning garnered a general acceptance. Later Muslim sources, those of the eighth century, began to hold that Idris had two names, Idris and Enoch, and other sources even stated that Idris true name is Enoch and that he is called Idris in Arabic because of his devotion to the study of the sacred books of his ancestors Adam and Seth. Therefore, these later sources also highlighted Idris as either meaning interpreter or having some meaning close to that of an interpretive role. Several of the classical commentators on the Quran, such as Al-Baizawi, said he was called Idris from the Arabic dars, meaning to study, from his knowledge of divine mysteries.",

      // Muslim literature (topic)
      "history3" : "According to later Muslim writings, Idris was born in Babylon, a city in present-day Iraq. Before he received the Revelation, he followed the rules revealed to Prophet Seth, the son of Adam. When Idris grew older, God bestowed Prophethood on him. During his lifetime all the people were not yet Muslims. Afterwards, Idris left his hometown of Babylon because a great number of the people committed many sins even after he told them not to do so. Some of his people left with Idris. It was hard for them to leave their home.They asked Prophet Idris: If we leave Babylon, where will we find a place like it? Prophet Idris said: If we immigrate for the sake of Allah, He will provide for us. So the people went with Prophet Idris and they reached the land of Egypt. They saw the Nile River. Idris stood at its bank and mentioned Allah, the Exalted, by saying: SubhanAllah.Islamic literature narrates that Idris was made prophet at around 40, which parallels the age when Muhammad began to prophesy, and lived during a time when people had begun to worship fire. Exegesis embellishes upon the lifetime of Idris, and states that the prophet divided his time into two. For three days of the week, Idris would preach to his people and four days he would devote solely to the worship of God. Many early commentators, such as Tabari, credited Idris with possessing great wisdom and knowledge.Exegesis narrates that Idris was among the first men to use the pen as well as being one of the first men to observe the movement of the stars and set out scientific weights and measures. These attributes remain consistent with the identification of Enoch with Idris, as these attributes make it clear that Idris would have most probably lived during the Generations of Adam, the same era during which Enoch lived. Ibn Arabi described Idris as the prophet of the philosophers and a number of works were attributed to him. Some scholars wrote commentaries on these supposed works, all while Idris was also credited with several inventions, including the art of making garments.The commentator Ibn Ishaq narrated that he was the first man to write with a pen and that he was born when Adam still had 308 years of his life to live. In his commentary on the Quranic verses 19:56-57, the commentator Ibn Kathir narrated During the Night Journey, the Prophet passed by him in fourth heaven. In a hadith, Ibn Abbas asked Ka’b what was meant by the part of the verse which says, And We raised him to a high station. Ka’b explained: Allah revealed to Idris: ‘I would raise for you every day the same amount of the deeds of all Adam’s children’ – perhaps meaning of his time only. So Idris wanted to increase his deeds and devotion. A friend of his from the angels visited and Idris said to him: ‘Allah has revealed to me such and such, so could you please speak to the angel of death, so I could increase my deeds.’ The angel carried him on his wings and went up into the heavens. When they reached the fourth heaven, they met the angel of death who was descending down towards earth. The angel spoke to him about what Idris had spoken to him before. The angel of death said: ‘But where is Idris?’ He replied, ‘He is upon my back.’ The angel of death said: ‘How astonishing! I was sent and told to seize his soul in the fourth heaven. I kept thinking how I could seize it in the fourth heaven when he was on the earth?’ Then he took his soul out of his body, and that is what is meant by the verse: ‘And We raised him to a high station.’Early accounts of Idris' life attributed thirty portions of revealed scripture to him. Therefore, Idris was understood by many early commentators to be both a prophet as well as a messenger.

      "history4" : "Idris is generally accepted to be the same as Enoch, the patriarch who lived in the Generations of Adam. Many Qur'anic commentators, such as al-Tabari and Qadi Baydawi, identified Idris with Enoch. Baizawi said, Idris was of the posterity of Seth and a forefather of Noah, and his name was Enoch (Ar. Akhnukh) Bursalı İsmail Hakkı's commentary on Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam by ibn ʿArabi.Modern scholars, however, do not concur with this identification because they argue that it lacks definitive proof. As translator Abdullah Yusuf Ali says in note 2508 of his translation of the Quran: Idris is mentioned twice in the Quran, viz., here and in Chapter 21, verse 85, where he is mentioned as among those who patiently persevered. His identification with the Biblical Enoch, may or may not be correct. Nor are we justified in interpreting verse 57 here as meaning the same thing as in Genesis, v.24 (God took him), that he was taken up without passing through the portals of death. All we are told is he was a man of truth and sincerity, and a prophet, and that he had a high position among his people.— Abdullah Yusuf Ali, The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary. With this identification, Idris's father becomes Yarid (يريد), his mother Barkanah, and his wife Aadanah. Idris's son Methuselah would eventually be the grandfather of Nuh (Noah). Hence Idris is identified as the great-grandfather of Noah",

      "history5" : "Antoine Faivre, in The Eternal Hermes (1995), has pointed out that Hermes Trismegistus (a syncretic combination of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth) has a place in the Islamic tradition, although the name Hermes does not appear in the Quran. Hagiographers and chroniclers of the first centuries of the Islamic Hijrah quickly identified Hermes Trismegistus with Idris, the Prophet of surat 19.56-57 and 21.85, whom the Arabs also identified with Enoch (cf. Genesis 5.18–24). Idris/Hermes was termed Thrice-Wise Hermes Trismegistus because he had a threefold origin. The first Hermes, comparable to Thoth, was a civilizing hero, an initiator into the mysteries of the divine science and wisdom that animate the world; he carved the principles of this sacred science in Egyptian hieroglyphs. The second Hermes, in Babylon, was the initiator of Pythagoras. The third Hermes was the first teacher of alchemy. A faceless prophet, writes the Islamicist Pierre Lory, Hermes possesses no concrete or salient characteristics, differing in this regard from most of the major figures of the Bible and the Quran. A common interpretation of the representation of Trismegistus as thrice great recalls the three characterizations of Idris: as a messenger of god, or a prophet; as a source of wisdom, or hikmet (wisdom from hokhmah); and as a king of the world order, or a sultanate. These are referred to as müselles bin ni'me.The star-worshipping sect known as the Sabians of Harran also believed that their doctrine descended from Hermes Trismegistus.",

      "history8" : "Prophet Idris was born during the lifetime of Prophet Adam. He was from amongst the followers of Sheath (Seth) and ruled the progeny of Adam following the death of Sheath. He was truthful, patient and an extraordinary individual— it is reported in hadith by Abu-Dharr that Idris was the first man to introduce the art of reading and writing to mankind.Idris was a sincere servant of Allah, hence Allah chose him as a Prophet and Messenger, and elected him as the ruler over the children of Adam.What began after death of Sheath is the people of Cain lost guidance and sin and corruption began increasing rapidly and spreading. Idris could not bear to watch his own people falling prey to the influence of shaitan. So Allah instructed Prophet Idris to call for Jihad (holy war) against the corrupt followers of Qabil (Cain) —Idris was the first Prophet and Messenger in the history of Islam to perform Jihad against corruption.And as commanded by Allah, Idris gathered an army of men and battled in the name of Allah against the transgressors and emerged victorious.One day, Prophet Idris was informed by Allah that he would receive the rewards of all the good deeds performed by man each day till his last breath.Prophet Idris was overjoyed with the news and thanked Allah immensely for all His blessings. But Idris was quite old, and was not quite ready to depart earth as enjoyed spreading good. So, he decided to speak to the Angel of death and plead him to delay his death. The Angel agreed to Idris’s plea and decided to meet with the Angel of death together with Idris.The Angel flew to the fourth heaven with Prophet Idris on his wings and met with the Angel of death. Idris’s dear companion said to the Angel of death, “Prophet Idris wants to know if you could prolong his life”. The Angel of death was stunned; he replied, “And where is Idris?” “He is upon my back”, answered the Angel. The Angel of death replied, “How astonishing! I was sent and told to cease Idris’s soul in the fourth heaven. I kept thinking how I could cease it in the fourth heaven when he was on earth. Subhanallah (glory be to God), He made it happen!” And as the Lord instructed the Angel of death, the soul of Idris was taken in the fourth heaven.Following the death of Prophet Idris, corruption began to increase rapidly again. Several generations later, with no Prophetic guidance, Satan finally managed to influence the children of Adam to commit their first act of shirk (polytheism).",

Noah's mission was to warn his people, who were plunged in depravity and sin. God charged Noah with the duty of preaching to his people, advising them to abandon idolatry and to worship only God and to live good and pure lives. Although he preached the Message of God with zeal, his people refused to mend their ways, leading to building the Ark and the Deluge, the Great Flood. In Islamic tradition, it is disputed whether the Great Flood was a global or a local one. Noah's preaching and prophethood spanned 950 years according to the Quran.Noah's mission had a double character: he had to warn his people, asking them to call for repentance and, at the same time, he had to preach about God's mercy and forgiveness, promising them the glad tidings God would provide if they led righteous lives.

Noah had firm belief in the oneness of God, and preached Islam (literally submission, meaning submission to God). He continuously warned the people of the painful doom that was coming and asked them to accept one God instead of worshipping idols such as Wadd, Suwa', Yaghuth, Ya'uq and Nasr. He called the people to serve God, and said that nobody but God could save them.He said that the time of the deluge was appointed and could not be delayed, and that the people had to submit to God. God commanded Noah to build a ship, the Ark, and as he was building it, the chieftains passed him and mocked him. Upon its completion, the ship is said to be loaded with pairs of every animal, and Noah's household, and a group of believers who did submit to God. The people who denied the message of Noah, including one of his own sons, drowned.The final resting place of the ship was referred to as Al-Jūdiyy  or a Munzalanm-Mubārakan (Arabic: مُنْزَلًا مُّبَارَكًا, romanized: Place-of-Landing Blessed).

Among Adam's descendants there were many brave and pious men, greatly loved and revered by their respective communities. Exegesis goes on to narrate that, upon the death of these elders, people felt enormous grief and some felt prompted to make statues of these people in remembrance of them. Then gradually, through the generations many forgot what such statues were for and began to worship them, (as the Shaytan (Satan) slowly deceived each generation) along with many other idols.

He would praise God consistently and he urged his people to do the same, warning his tribe of the punishment they would face if they did not mend their ignorant ways. The Qur'an states that Noah repeatedly told his people: O my people, worship God; you have no deity other than Him. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day! Early on, a few were moved by Noah's words but the powerful and wealthy members of the tribe refused to hear his call. The unbelievers at the time were impelled to rebel by various evil motives. Firstly, they were extremely envious and jealous of men superior to them in any way. Secondly, the people were ignorant of the weak and lowly, who were frequently superior intellectually, morally and spiritually. As a result of their ignorance, they were arrogant and mocked all who they felt were inferior to them. Saying Are we to believe you, when those who follow you are the most abject of people? Noah responded: Their judgment rests only with my Lord, if you could perceive.When Noah preached the faith of God to them, all they did was revile the messenger, abuse the message and call the whole warning a lie. He then went on to explain the Message in greater depth, ensuring them that it was not a message of destruction but it was a message with the mercy from God, and that their acts would lead to destruction if they did not accept the faith. He questioned them, asking why they would not accept what would benefit them in the near future.

When Noah began building the Ark, the people who saw him at work laughed at him even more than before. Their conclusion was that he was surely a madman – they could not find any other reason why a man would build a huge vessel when no sea or river was nearby.

      "history8" : "Little is known of Noah's personal history before his call to prophecy. However, Ibn Kathir records him to have been the son of Lamech and grandson of Methuselah, one of the patriarchs from the Generations of Adam. Noah was neither the leader of the tribe nor a very rich man but, even before being called to prophecy, he worshiped God faithfully and was, in the words of the Qur'an, a devotee most grateful.Noah was married to a woman whose name is not mentioned in the Quran. Some Islamic historians such as Al-Tabari have suggested that the name of Noah's wife was Umzarah bint Barakil but this cannot be confirmed. Most Muslims simply call her by her midrashic name Naamah.[citation needed] Islamic scholars agree that Noah had four sons whose names were Ham, Shem, Yam and Japheth. According to the Quran, one of Noah's sons was a disbeliever who had pretended faith in front of Noah and who refused to come aboard the Ark, instead preferring to climb a mountain, where he drowned. It is agreed among most Islamic scholars that Yam was the one who drowned; the other three remained believers.The Quran states that Noah's wife was not a believer with him so she did not join him. The sons of Noah are not expressly mentioned in the Qur'an, except for the fact that one of the sons was among the people who did not follow his own father, not among the believers and thus was washed away in the flood. Also the Qur'an indicates a great calamity, enough to have destroyed Noah's people, but to have saved him and his generations to come.Noah's wife (Naamah) is referred to in the Qur'an as an evil woman. When God emphasizes upon the notion that everyone is for themselves on the Day of Judgement and that marital relations will not be to your aid when the judgement takes place, the Qur'an says: God sets forth, for an example to the Unbelievers, the wife of Noah and the wife of Lut: they were (respectively) under two of our righteous servants, but they were false to their (husbands), and they profited nothing before God on their account, but were told: Enter ye the Fire along with (others) that enter! — Qur'an 66:10 .In contrast, the wife of the Pharaoh of the Exodus, Asiya, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, are referred to as among the best of women.

A Chaldean Archbishop of Babylon, that is Prince Nouri, had travelled from Kochanis in Turkey to Urmiah in Persia. In Urmiah, he met with Dr. Frederick B. Coan, and told him that during the journey, after making three attempts to find the ark, he went to it on the 25th of April, 1887. Accounts collected by Dr. Lee Spencer and Dr. Jean Luc Lienard of the Southwestern Adventist University in the U.S.A., regarding a number of those who claimed to have seen the ark, point to the ark being in south-eastern Turkey, in a mountainous region with swamps, lakes and oil fields, south of Lake Van and west of Lake Urmia , 3. Based on an interpretation of the Qur'an (11:44). It is believed that after coming down from the ark on this mountain, Noah and the survivors of the flood (who are thought to have numbered around 80) built a settlement to the south of the mountain, named Thamanin or Themanin, (meaning Eighty) after the number of survivors. It is located east of Cizre (at the headwaters of the Tigris River, near the modern border with Syria, and that of Iraq), southeast of Şah (Çağlayan), and northwest of the Iraqi city of Zakho. , 4.

      // Historical context(Topic)
      "history1" : "Hud has sometimes been identified with Eber, an ancestor of the Ishmaelites and the Israelites who is mentioned in the Old Testament.He is said to have been a subject of a mulk (Arabic: مُلك, kingdom) named after its founder, 'Ad, a fourth-generation descendant of Noah (his father being Uz, the son of Aram, who was the son of Shem, who in turn was a son of Noah):The ʿĀd people, with their prophet Hud, are mentioned in many places. See especially Quran 26:123–140 (Yusuf Ali), and Quran 46:21–26 (Yusuf Ali). Their eponymous ancestor ʿAd was fourth in generation from Noah, having been a son of 'Aus, the son of Aram, the son of Sam, the son of Noah. They occupied a large tract of country in Southern Arabia, extending from Umman at the mouth of the Persian Gulf to Hadhramaut and Yemen at the southern end of the Red Sea. The people were tall in stature and were great builders. Probably the long, winding tracts of sands (ahqaf) in their dominions (46:21) were irrigated with canals. They forsook the true God, and oppressed their people. A three years famine visited them, but yet they took no warning. At length a terrible blast of wind destroyed them and their land, but a remnant, known as the second ʿĀd or the Thamud (see below) were saved, and afterwards suffered a similar fate for their sins. The tomb of the Prophet Hud (qabr Nabi Hud) is still traditionally shown in Hadhramaut, latitude 16 N, and longitude 491⁄2 E, about 90 miles north of Mukalla. There are ruins and inscriptions in the neighborhood.— Abdullah Yusuf Ali, The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary, Note 1040 The other tribes claimed to be present at this time in Arabia, were the Thamud, Jurhum, Tasam, Jadis, Amim, Midian, Amalek Imlaq, Jasim, Qahtan, Banu Yaqtan and others.The Quran gives the location of ʿĀd as being Al-Aḥqāf (Arabic: ٱلْأَحقَاف, The Sandy Plains, or The Wind-curved Sand-hills). It is believed to have been in South Arabia, possibly in eastern Yemen and/or western Oman. In November 1991, a settlement was discovered and hypothesized to be Ubar, which is thought to be mentioned in the Qur'an as Iram dhāt al-ʿImād (Iram of the Pillars or Iram of the tentpoles), and may have been the capital of ʿĀd. One of the members of the original expedition, archeologist Juris Zarins, however, later concluded that the discovery did not represent a city called Ubar. In a 1996 interview on the subject, he said: If you look at the classical texts and the Arab historical sources, Ubar refers to a region and a group of people, not to a specific town. People always overlook that. It's very clear on Ptolemy's second century map of the area. It says in big letters Iobaritae. And in his text that accompanied the maps, he's very clear about that. It was only the late medieval version of One Thousand and One Nights, in the fourteenth or fifteenth century, that romanticised Ubar and turned it into a city, rather than a region or a people.The Moroccan mystic Abdulaziz ad-Dabbagh gives detailed information about Hud: According to him, 53:50 (Shakir) alludes to the fact that Hud was sent to the second ʿAd tribe, which lived after Noah. The first 'Ad tribe had a messenger named Huwayd, whose message was to be revived by Hud, and the tribe was destroyed with stones and fire by God. Hud was Eber's son (see Eber in Islam for his genealogy) and Iram was the name of one of the tribes of 'Ad, specifically the one Hud was sent to (see Iram in the Qur'an).",

However, the ʿĀd people's wealth ultimately proved to be their failure, as they became arrogant and forsook God and began to adopt idols for worship, including three named Samd, Samud and Hara.[11] Hud, even in childhood, remained consistent in prayer to God. It is related through exegesis that Hud's mother, a pious woman who had seen great visions at her son's birth, was the only person who encouraged Hud in his worship.[20] Thus, the Lord raised up Hud as a prophet for the ʿĀd people.When Hud started preaching and invited them to the worship of only the true God and when he told them to repent for their past sins and ask for mercy and forgiveness, the ʿĀd people began to revile him and wickedly began to mock God's message. Hud's story epitomizes the prophetic cycle common to the early prophets mentioned in the Quran: the prophet is sent to his people to tell them to worship God only and tells them to acknowledge that it is God who is the provider of their blessings[9] The Quran[3] states: We sent to the people of 'Ad their brother Hud, who said: O my people, worship God; you have no other god but He. (As for the idols,) you are only inventing lies. O my people, I ask no recompense of you for it: My reward is with Him who created me. Will you not, therefore, understand? O my people, beg your Lord to forgive you, and turn to Him in repentance. He will send down rain in torrents for you from the skies, and give you added strength. So do not turn away from Him as sinners.They said: O Hud, you have come to us with no proofs. We shall not abandon our gods because you say so, nor believe in you. All we can say is that some of our gods have smitten you with evil. He replied: I call God to witness, and you be witness too, that I am clear of what you associate (in your affairs) Apart from Him. Contrive against me as much as you like, and give me no respite. I place my trust in God who is my Lord and your Lord. There is no creature that moves on the earth who is not held by the forelock firmly by Him. Verily the way of my Lord is straight. If you turn away, then (remember) I have delivered to you the message I was sent with. My Lord will put other people in your place, and you will not be able to prevail against Him. Indeed my Lord keeps a watch over all things.     —Qur'an, Surah 11 (Hud), Ayat 50–57 ",
